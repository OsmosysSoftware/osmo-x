## Supported Providers

| Channel | Providers |
|---------|-----------|
| **Email** | SMTP, Mailgun, AWS SES |
| **SMS** | Twilio, Plivo, AWS SNS |
| **WhatsApp** | Twilio, Twilio Business, 360Dialog |
| **Push** | AWS SNS |

## Architecture Overview

OsmoX follows a queue-based architecture for reliable notification delivery:

1. **API Layer** - NestJS backend handling REST and GraphQL requests
2. **Queue System** - Bull queues (Redis-backed) for asynchronous processing
3. **Provider Integration** - Modular provider implementations for each channel
4. **Portal** - Angular frontend for management and monitoring

<Note>
  The scheduler component must be running for notifications to be processed. See the [Development Setup](/getting-started/development) guide for details.
